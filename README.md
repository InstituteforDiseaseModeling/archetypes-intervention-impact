# malaria-atlas-project

Repo for the IDM-MAP collaboration led by Amelia Bertozzi-Villa. Directories:

* archetypes: code to extract, dimensionality-reduce, and classify MAP covariate surfaces. Used to id the sites selected in intervention_impact.
* intervention_impact: primary folder for running dtk simulations on the basis of archetypes found in the seasonal_classification folder.
* megatrends: code specifically related to the WHO/Lancet work with Pete to assess eradication feasibility.
* spatial.py: Amelia's custom python geospatial package. 
* vector_bionomics: code to assess Marianne Sinka's vector database for inclusion into species parameters at IDM.
