Repo for the IDM-MAP collaboration led by Amelia Bertozzi-Villa. Directories:

* accessibility: preliminary scripts for generating custom accessibility surfaces. For more detail and updated examples see https://github.com/bertozzivill/friction-example.
* intervention_impact: primary folder for running dtk simulations on the basis of archetypes found in the seasonal_classification folder.
* itn_cube: geospatial modeling code from Sam Bhatt, to be adapted into a paper.
* seasonality_classification: code to extract, dimensionality-reduce, and classify MAP covariate surfaces. Used to id the sites selected in intervention_impact.
* stratification_comparison_april_2018: code to answer Jaline's question on model differences between IDM and MAP for the May 2018 Gates Review.
* spatial.py: Amelia's custom python geospatial package.
